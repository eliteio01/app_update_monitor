## Usage

You can use the `app_update_monitor` package to check the version of your app against the versions available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

### Example

```dart
import 'package:app_update_monitor/app_update_monitor.dart';

void main() async {
  const googlePlayPackageName = 'com.example.app';
  const appleId = '123456789';

  final versionChecker = VersionChecker(
    appleId: appleId, 
    googlePlayPackageName: googlePlayPackageName
  );

  final versionInfo = await versionChecker.checkVersion();

  print('Current Version: ${versionInfo.currentVersion}');
  print('Store Version: ${versionInfo.storeVersion}');
  print('Should update: ${versionInfo.shouldUpdate}');
  print('App Store Link: ${versionInfo.appStoreLink}');
  print('Play Store Link: ${versionInfo.playStoreLink}');
}
```

In the above example, replace `googlePlayPackageName` and `appleId` with your app‚Äôs package name and Apple ID respectively.

### Output

- `currentVersion`: The version of the app installed on the device.
- `storeVersion`: The latest version available in the respective app store (App Store or Google Play Store).
- `shouldUpdate`: A boolean value indicating if the app needs to be updated.
- `appStoreLink`: The link to the app in the Apple App Store.
- `playStoreLink`: The link to the app in the Google Play Store.

## API Documentation

The `VersionChecker` class provides a simple API to check for the latest app version:

### VersionChecker Constructor

  required this.googlePlayPackageName,
  this.countryCode = 'us',
});
```

- `appleId`: The Apple App Store ID of your app (required for iOS).
- `googlePlayPackageName`: The Google Play package name of your app (required for Android).
- `countryCode`: The country code used to get the store version, defaults to `'us'`.

### `checkVersion()` Method

```dart
Future<VersionInfo> checkVersion()
```

This method checks the current version of your app and compares it with the version in the App Store or Google Play Store.

- **Returns**: `VersionInfo` object that contains the following fields:
    - `currentVersion`: The current installed version of your app.
    - `storeVersion`: The latest version available in the app store.
    - `shouldUpdate`: A boolean indicating whether the app should be updated.
    - `appStoreLink`: The URL link to your app in the Apple App Store.
    - `playStoreLink`: The URL link to your app in the Google Play Store.

### `_shouldUpdate()` Method
